<h3>Doubt is better than certainty.</h3>
Doubt is better than certainty. Everyone always talks about confidence in<br>
believing what you do. I remember once going to a class in yoga where <br>
the teacher said that, spirituality speaking, if you believed that you had achieved enlightenment you have merely arrived at your limitation. I think that is also true in a practical sense.
