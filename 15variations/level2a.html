<h1>Doubt is better than certainty.</h1>
<h3>Everyone always talks about confidence</h3>
<h3>in believing what you do. </h3>
I remember once going to a class in yoga <br>
 <br><strong>where the teacher said that, spirituality speaking,</strong>
 <h1>if you believed that you had achieved enlightenment</h1>
 you have merely arrived at your limitation. I think that is also true in a practical sense.
<h1>Doubt is better than certainty.</h1>
