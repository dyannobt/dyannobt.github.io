        9:32 a.m.<br>
        trapped to their couches in the command module atop the 363-foot, 7.6-million-pound thrust space vehicle are three astronauts:Commander Neil A. Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins and  Lunar Module Pilot Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin, Jr.
        On schedule to within less than a second, Apollo 11 blasts off from Launch Pad 39A at Cape Kennedy, Florida.
      </div>

      <div class="event1aa">
        From Launch Control the last words were: <br> "Good luck and Godspeed." Commander Armstrong replied, "Thank you very much. We know this will be a good flight."
      </div>
      <div class="event1b">
        9:44 a.m.<br>
        Apollo 11 enters a 103 nautical mile-high Earth orbit, during which the vehicle is carefully checked by the astronauts and by the ground control crew.
      </div>
      <div class="event1c">
        12:22 p.m.<br>
        Another firing of the third-stage engine, still attached to the command service module, boosts Apollo 11 out of orbit midway in its second trip around the Earth and onto its lunar trajectory at an initial speed of 24,200 miles an hour.
      </div>
      <div class="event1d">
        12:49 p.m.<br>
        The astronauts first fire some explosive bolts. These cause the main spaceship, to separate from the adapter and blow apart the four panels that make up its sides, exposing the lunar module (LM) tucked inside. They stop the spacecraft about 100 feet away -34 feet farther than they were supposed to-turn the ship around, facing the landing craft, and dock head-to-head with it.
      </div>
      <div class="event1e">
        2:54 p.m.<br>
        The spacecraft is reported 22,000 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at 12,914 feet per second. Crew members keep busy with housekeeping duties.
      </div>
      <div class="event1f">
        8:52 p.m.<br>
        Mission Control at Houston, Texas, says good night to the crew as they prepare to go to sleep two hours early.
      </div>
      <div class="event1g">
        10:59 p.m.<br>
        Because of the pull of Earth's gravity, the spacecraft has slowed to 7,279 feet per second at a distance of 63,880 nautical miles from Earth.
      </div>




      <div class="event2a">
       8:48 a.m.<br>
       Mission Control gives Apollo crew a brief review of the morning news, including sports developments. They are informed about the progress of the Russian space ship Lunar 15 and that Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff, has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000.
      </div>
      <div class="event2b">
      12:17 p.m.<br>
      Midcourse correction is made with a three-second burn, sharpening the course of the spacecraft and testing the engine that must get them in and out of lunar orbit.
      </div>
      <div class="event2c">
        7:31 p.m.<br>
      Astronauts begin first scheduled color telecast from spacecraft, showing view of the Earth from a distance of about 128,000 nautical miles. During the 36-minute transmission, views are also shown of the inside of the command module.
      </div>
      <div class="event2d">
        9:41 p.m.<br>
     Mission control bids the crew goodnight.
      </div>





    <div class="event3a">
      9:41 a.m.<br>
      Mission Control let Astronauts sleep an hour later than scheduled on the third day of the outward journey. After breakfast, they begin housekeeping chores, such as charging batteries, dumping waste water, and checking fuel and oxygen reserves. Announcement is made to them that course corrections scheduled for afternoon will not be necessary.
    </div>
    <div class="event3b">
      4:40 p.m.<br>
      One of the clearest television transmissions ever sent from space is begun, with the spacecraft 175,000 nautical miles from Earth and 48,000 from the Moon. It lasts an hour and 36 minutes. While in progress, the hatch to the LM is opened and Armstrong squeezes through the 30-inch-wide tunnel to inspect it. He is followed by Aldrin.
    </div>
    <div class="event3c">
      10:00 p.m.<br>
      Mission Control tells the crew goodnight.
    </div>
    <div class="event3d">
      11:12p.m.<br>
      The Velocity of spacecraft slows to 2,990 ft. per second just before entering the Moon's sphere of influence at a point 33,823 nautical miles away from it.
    </div>





    <div class="event4a">
      6:58 a.m.<br>
      Astronauts call Mission Control to inquire about scheduled course correction and are told it has been cancelled. They are then advised they can go back to sleep.
    </div>
    <div class="event4b">
      10:42 a.m. <br>
      Armstrong announces: "The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It about three-quarters of the hatch window and, of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earth-shine. It's a view worth the price of the trip."
    </div>
    <div class="event4c">
      1:13 p.m. <br>
      Spacecraft passes completely behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth for the first time.
    </div>
    <div class="event4d">
      1:28 p.m. <br>
      The spacecraft's main rocket, a 20,500-pound-thrust engine, is fired for about six minutes to slow the vehicle so that it can be captured by lunar gravity. It is still behind the Moon. The resulting orbit ranges from a low of 61.3 nautical miles to a high of 168.8 nautical miles.
    </div>
    <div class="event4e">
      1:55 p.m. <br>
      Armstrong tells Mission Control: "We're getting this first view of the landing approach. This time we are going over the Taruntius crater and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollos 8 and 10 give us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and watching it on TV-no substitute for actually being here."
    </div>
    <div class="event4f">
      6:57pm <br>
      <br>Armstrong and Aldrin crawl through the tunnel into the lunar module to give it another check. The spacecraft is orbiting the Moon every two hours.
    </div>




    <div class="event5a">
      9:27 a.m.<br>
      Aldrin crawls into the lunar module and starts to power-up the spacecraft. Later, Armstrong enters the LM and together they continue to check the systems and deploy the landing legs.
    </div>
    <div class="event5b">
      1:46 p.m.<br>
      The landing craft is separated from the command module, in which Collins continues to orbit the Moon.
    </div>
    <div class="event5c">
      3:08 p.m.<br>
      Armstrong and Aldrin, flying feet first and face down, fire the landing craft's descent engine for the first time.
    </div>
    <div class="event5d">
      3:47 p.m.<br>
      Collins, flying the command ship from behind the Moon, reports to Earth that the landing craft is on its way down to the lunar surface. It is the first Mission Control has heard of the action. "Everything's going just swimmingly. Beautiful!" Collins reports.
    </div>
    <div class="event5e">
      4:05 p.m.<br>
      Armstrong throttles up the engine to slow the LM before dropping down on the lunar surface. The landing is not easy. The site they approach is four miles from the target point, on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility. Seeing that they are approaching a crater about the size of a football field and covered with large rocks, Armstrong takes over manual control and steers the craft to a smoother spot. His heartbeat has risen from a normal 77 to 156.
    </div>
    <div class="event5f">
      4:18 p.m.<br>
      The craft settles down with a jolt almost like that of a jet landing on a runway. It is at an angle of no more than four or five degrees on the right side of the Moon as seen from Earth. Armstrong immediately radios Mission Control: "The Eagle has landed."
